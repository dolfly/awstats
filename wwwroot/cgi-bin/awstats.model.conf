# AWStats configure file
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file into awstats.www.mydomain.conf or awstats.conf and edit this
# new file to setup AWStats (See documentation in docs/ directory).
# The config file must be in /etc/opt/awstats, /etc/awstats or /etc (for
# Unix/Linux) or same directory than awstats.pl (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux...)
# To include an environment variable in any parameter (AWStats will replace
# it with its value when reading it), follow the example:

# MAIN SETUP SECTION (Required to make AWStats working)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "LogFile" contains the web server logfile to analyze.
# Possible values: A full path, or a relative path from awstats.pl directory.
# Example: "/var/log/apache/access.log"
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
# You can also use tags in this filename if you need a dynamic file name
# depending on date or time (Replacement is made by AWStats at the beginning
# of its execution). This is available tags :
#   %YYYY-n  is replaced with 4 digits year we were n hours ago
#   %YY-n    is replaced with 2 digits year we were n hours ago
#   %MM-n    is replaced with month we were n hours ago
#   %DD-n    is replaced with day we were n hours ago
#   %HH-n    is replaced with hour we were n hours ago
#   %NS-n    is replaced with number of seconds at 00:00 since 1970
#   %WM-n    is replaced with the week number in month (1-5)
#   %WY-n    is replaced with the week number in year (1-52)
#   %DW-n    is replaced with the day number in week (1-7, 1=sunday)
#                              use n=24 if you need (1-7, 1=monday)
#   Use 0 for n if you need current year, month, day, hour...
# Example: "/var/log/access_log.%YYYY-0%MM-0%DD-0.log"
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/ex%YY-24%MM-24%DD-24.log"
# You can also use a pipe if log file come from a pipe.
# Example: "gzip -d </var/log/apache/access.log.gz |"
#
LogFile="/var/log/httpd/mylog.log"


# Put here your log format (Must match your web server config. See setup
# instructions in documentation know how to configure your web server to have
# the required log format).
# Possible values: 1,2,3,4,5 or "your_own_personalized_log_format"
# 1 - Apache native combined log format (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format)
# 2 - IIS log format (W3C log format)
# 3 - Webstar native log format
# 4 - Apache or Squid native common log format (NCSA common log format)
#     With LogFormat=4, some features (browsers, os, keywords...) can't work.
# 5 - ISA server native standard log format
# "your_own_personalized_log_format" = If your log is a personalized format,
#   you must use the following syntax keys to define the log format string:
#   %host             Host client name or IP address
#   %logname          Authenticated login/user used on protected pages
#   %time1            Date and time with format: [dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss +0000]
#   %time1b           Date and time with format: [dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss]
#   %time2            Date and time with format: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
#   %methodurl        Method and URL with format: "GET /index.html HTTP/x.x"
#   %methodurlnoprot  Method and URL with format: "GET /index.html"
#   %method           Method with format: GET
#   %url              URL only with format: /index.html
#   %query            Query string (used by URLWithQuery option)
#   %code             HTTP return code with format: 999
#   %bytesd           Size of document in bytes
#   %refererquot      Referer page with format: "http://from.com/from.htm"
#   %referer          Referer page with format: http://from.com/from.htm
#   %uaquot           User agent with format: "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible, ...)"
#   %ua               User agent with format: Mozilla/4.0_(compatible...)
#   %gzipin           Mod_gzip compression input bytes: In:XXX
#   %gzipout          Mod_gzip compression output bytes & ratio: Out:YYY:ZZZpct.
#   %gzipratio        Mod_gzip compression ratio: ZZZpct.
#   %syslog           Syslog-specific time and host stamp with format: Mon dd hh:mm:ss hostname
#   %virtualname      Web sever virtual hostname. Use this tag when same log
#                     file contains data of several virtual web servers. The
#                     SiteDomain will be used to filter the one you want.
#   If your log format has some fields not included in this list, use
#   %other            Means another field
#
# Examples for Apache combined logs (this two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 1
# LogFormat = "%host %other %logname %time1 %methodurl %code %bytesd %refererquot %uaquot"
#
# Examples for IIS (this two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 2
# LogFormat = "%time2 %host %logname %method %url %code %bytesd %other %ua %referer"
#
LogFormat=1


# If your log field's separator is not a space, you can change this parameter.
# Example: " "
# Example: "\t"
# Example: "|"
# Default: " "
#
LogSeparator=" "


# If you want to have information on domains/countries visitors, you must ask
# AWStats to make reverse DNS lookup (if not already done in your log file).
# With DNSLookup to 0, all hosts will be reported by their IP addresses and
# not by the full hostname of visitors. Domain/Country chart will also report
# all visitors from a domain/country "Unknown".
# If you need to set DNSLookup to 1, don't forget that reverse DNS lookup
# increase dramatically AWStats update process. Do not use on large web sites.
# Possible values:
# 0 - No DNS Lookup
# 1 - DNS Lookup is fully enabled
# 2 - DNS Lookup is made only from DNS cache file
# Default: 2
# 
DNSLookup=2


# When AWStats updates its statistics, it stores results of its analysis in 
# files (AWStats database). All those files are written in the directory
# defined by the "DirData" parameter. Set this value to the directory where
# you want AWStats to save its database and working files into.
# Warning: If you want to be able to use the "AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser"
# feature (see later), you need "Write" permissions by web server user on this
# directory (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Example: "/var/cache/awstats"
# Example: "../data"
# Example: "C:/awstats_data_dir"
# Default: "."          (means same directory as awstats.pl)
#
DirData="."


# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats.pl directory.
# This parameter is used only when AWStats is run from command line
# with -output option (to generate links in HTML reported page).
# Default: "/cgi-bin"   (means awstats.pl is in "/mywwwroot/cgi-bin")
#
DirCgi="/cgi-bin"


# Relative or absolute web URL of all icons subdirectories.
# Default: "/icon" (means you must copy icon directories in "/mywwwroot/icon")
#
DirIcons="/icon"


# "SiteDomain" must contain the main domain name or the main intranet web
# server name used to reach the web site.
# If you share the same log file for several virtual web servers, this
# parameter is used to tell AWStats to filter record that contains records for
# this virtual host name only (So check that this virtual hostname can be
# found in your log file and use a personalized log format that include the
# %virtualname tag).
# But for multi hosting a better solution is to have one log file for each
# virtual web server. In this case, this parameter is only used to generate
# full URL's links when ShowLinksOnUrl option is set to 1.
# Example: "www.mydomain.com"
# Example: "user.mydomain.com"
# Example: "myintranetserver"
#
SiteDomain=""


# Put here all other possible domain names, addresses or virtual host aliases
# someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum number of
# possible names/addresses to have the best performances.
# You can repeat the "SiteDomain" value in this list.
# Use space between each value.
# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL of
# another site.
# Example: "www.myserver.com x.y.z.w localhost 127.0.0.1"
#
HostAliases="www.myserver.com x.y.z.w localhost 127.0.0.1"


# When this parameter is set to 1, AWStats add a button on report page to
# allow to "update" statistics from a web browser. Warning, when "update" is
# made from a browser, AWStats is ran as a CGI by the web server user defined
# in your web server (user "nobody" by default with Apache, "IUSR_XXX" with
# IIS), so the "DirData" directory and all already existing history files
# awstatsMMYYYY[.xxx].txt must be writable by this user. Change permissions if
# necessary to "Read/Write" (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Warning: Update process can be long so you might experience "time out"
# browser errors if you don't launch AWStats enough frequently.
# When set to 0, update is only made when AWStats is ran from the command
# line interface (or a task scheduler).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser=0



#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a static DNS cache file that was
# previously created manually. If no path is gave in static DNS cache file
# name, AWStats will search DirData directory. This file is never changed.
# This option is not used if DNSLookup=0.
# Note: DNS cache file must have format:  ipaddress  resolved_hostname
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscache"
# Default: "dnscache.txt"
#
DNSStaticCacheFile="dnscache.txt"


# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a DNS cache file that was created
# by a previous run of AWStats. This file is erased and recreated after each
# statistics update process. You don't need to create and/or edit it.
# AWStats will read and save this file in DirData directory.
# This option is not used if DNSLookup=0.
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscachelastupdate"
# Default: "dnscachelastupdate.txt"
#
DNSLastUpdateCacheFile="dnscachelastupdate.txt"


# You can specify specific IP addresses that should NOT be looked up in
#  the DNS. You may specify partial addresses (ie 163.85. for everything
#  behind the usual firewall setup, etc)...
# This option is used only if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Example: "163.85. 201.101.51.2"
# Default: ""
#
SkipDNSLookupFor=""


# The following two parameters allow you to protect a config file to be used
# by your AWStats program called from a browser only if web user has been
# authenticated. Your AWStats program must be in a web protected "realm" (With
# Apache, you can use .htaccess files to do so. With other web servers, see
# your server setup manual).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=0


# This parameter give the list of all authorized authenticated users to view
# statistics for this domain/config file. This parameter is used only if
# AllowAccessToAuthenticatedUsersOnly is set to 1.
# Example: "user1 user2"
# Example: "__REMOTE_USER__"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers=""


# If the "DirData" directory (see above) does not exists, AWStats return an
# error. However, you can ask AWStats to create it.
# This option can be used by some Web Hosting Providers that has defined a 
# dynamic value for DirData (for example DirData="/home/__REMOTE_USER__") and
# don't want to have to create a new directory each time they add a new user.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
CreateDirDataIfNotExists=0


# In most case, AWStats is used as a cgi program. So AWStats process is ran
# by default web server user (nobody for Unix, IUSR_xxx for IIS/Windows,...).
# To make use easier and avoid permission's problems between update process 
# (run by an admin user) and CGI process (ran by a low level user), AWStats
# save its database files with read and write for everyone.
# If you have experience on managing security policies (Web Hosting Provider),
# you should set this parameter to 0. AWStats will keep default process user
# permissions on its files.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
SaveDatabaseFilesWithPermissionsForEveryone=1


# AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to detect new lines in log file, to process only them, so
# you can launch AWStats as soon as you want, even with this parameter to 0.
# With 0, no purge is made, so you must use a scheduled task or a web server
# that make this purge frequently.
# With 1, the purge of the log file is made each time AWStats is ran.
# This parameter doesn't work with IIS (This web server doesn't let its log
# file to be purged).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
PurgeLogFile=0


# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0


# Each time you run the update process, AWStats overwrite the 'historic file'
# for the month (awstatsMMYYYY[.*].txt) with the updated one.
# When write errors occurs (IO, disk full,...), this historic file can be
# corrupted and must be deleted. Because this file contains information of all
# past processed log files, you will loose old stats if removed. So you can
# ask AWStats to save last non corrupted file in a .bak file. This file is
# stored in "DirData" directory with other 'historic files'.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
KeepBackupOfHistoricFiles=0


# Default index page name for your web server.
# Example: "default.htm default.html"
# Default: "index.html"
#
DefaultFile="index.html"


# Do not include access from clients that match following criteria.
# If your log file contains IP adresses in host field, you must put here
# matching IP adresses criteria.
# If DNS lookup is already done in your log file, you must put here hostname
# criteria.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Example: "127.0.0.1 163.84. 201.101.51.1"
# Example: "localhost abcxyz"
# Default: ""
#
SkipHosts=""


# Use SkipFiles to ignore access to URLs that match one of following entries.
# You can, with this option, add a list of not important frame pages (like 
# menus, etc...) to exclude them from statistics.
# For example, to ignore a whole directory tree, just add "directorytoignore",
# to ignore "users" pages in your stats, you can add "/~".
# The oposite parameter of "SkipFiles" is "OnlyFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values.
# Note: xxx$ means URL ending with xxx.
# Example: "robots.txt$ favicon.ico$ badpage.html /~"
# Default: "robots.txt$ favicon.ico$"
#
SkipFiles="robots.txt$ favicon.ico$"


# Include in stats, only accesses to URLs that match one of following entries.
# For example, if you want AWStats to filter access to keep only stats that
# match a particular string, like a particular directory, you can add this
# directory name in this parameter.
# The opposite parameter of "OnlyFiles" is "SkipFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values
# Note: xxx$ means URL ending by xxx.
# Example: "marketing_directory"
# Default: ""
#
OnlyFiles=""


# Add here a list of kind of url (file extension) that must be counted as
# "Hit only" and not as a "Hit" and "Page/Download". You can set here all
# images extensions as they are hit downloaded that must be counted but they
# are not viewed pages. URLs with such extensions are not included in the TOP
# Pages/URL report.
# Note: If you want to exclude your own URLs from stats (No Pages and no Hits
# reported), you should use SkipFiles parameter instead.
# Example: ""
# Example: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp zip arj gz z wav mp3 wma mpg"
# Default: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp"
#
NotPageList="css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp"


# By default, AWStats considers that records found in log file are successful
# hits if HTTP code returned by server is a valid HTTP code (200 and 304).
# Any other code are reported in HTTP error chart.
# However in some specific environment, with web server HTTP redirection,
# you can choose to also accept other codes.
# Example: "200 304 302 305"
# Default: "200 304"
#
ValidHTTPCodes="200 304"


# Keep or attach the query string to the URL in the statistics for individual
# pages. This is primarily used to differentiate between the URLs of dynamic
# pages. If set to 1, mypage.html?id=x and mypage.html?id=y are counted as two
# different pages.
# Warning, when set to 1, memory required to run AWStats is dramatically
# increased if you have a lot of changing URLs (for example URLs with a random
# id inside). Such web sites should not set this option to 1.
# Possible values:
# 0 - URLs are cleaned from the query string (ie: "/mypage.html")
# 1 - Full URL with query string is used     (ie: "/mypage.html?x=y")
# Default: 0
# 
URLWithQuery=0


# AWStats can detect setup problems or show you important informations to have
# a better use. Keep this to 1, except if AWStats says you can change it.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
WarningMessages=1


# To help you to detect if your log format is good, AWStats report an error
# if all the first NbOfLinesForCorruptedLog lines have a format that does not
# match the LogFormat parameter.
# However, some worm virus attack on your web server can result in a very high
# number of corrupted lines in your log. So if you experience awstats stop
# because of bad virus records at the beginning of your log file, you can
# increase this parameter (very rare).
# Default: 50
#
NbOfLinesForCorruptedLog=50


# For some particular integration needs, you may want to have CGI links to
# point to another script than awstats.pl.
# Use the name of this script in WrapperScript parameter.
# Example: "awstatslauncher.pl"
# Default: ""
#
WrapperScript=""



#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL ACCURACY SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can change value for following option to disable/enable AWStats capabilities.
# Possible values: 0, 1
# Possible values: 0, 1 or 2 for LevelForRobotsDetection
