<a name="Unique Visitor">Unique Visitor</a>: A unique visitor is a host that has made at least 1 hit
on 1 page of a web site. If this host make several visits, it is counted only once.<br>
<br>

<a name="Visits">Visits</a>: Number of visits made by all visitors.<br>
Think "session" here, say a unique IP accesses a page, and then requests three others without an hour
between any of the requests, all of the "pages" are included in the visit, therefore you should expect
multiple pages per visit and multiple visits per unique visitor (assuming that some of the unique IPs are
logged with more than an hour between requests)<br>
<br>

<a name="Pages">Pages</a>: The number of "pages" logged. Only files that don't match an entry in the
NotPageList and match a file in the OnlyFiles directive are counted as "pages", usually pages are
reserved for HTML files or CGI files, not images or supplementary files requested as a result of loading the "page"<br>
<br>

<a name="Hits">Hits</a>: any files requested from the server (including those qualifying as "pages") except those
in the SkipFiles section. (NOTE: you've effectively skipped all files which would normally be considered hits and
restricted AWStats to only reporting accesses to your Java Server Pages, which is why your "pages" count and
hits are the same)<br>
<br>

<a name="Bandwith">Bandwith</a>: Total number of bytes downloaded.<br>
<br>

<a name="Entry Page">Entry Page</a>: First page loaded from a unique IP/address during their visit.<br>
<br>

<a name="Exit Page">Exit Page</a>: Last page viewed by a visitor during its visit.<br>
<br>

<a name="Grabber">Grabber</a>: a browser that is used primarily for copying locally an entire site. These include
for example "teleport", "webcapture", "webcopier"...<br>
