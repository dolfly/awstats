Note 0: Perl 5.005_03 or higher is a requirement to use AWStats 6.0 or higher.

Note 1: When migrating to 6.x series, if you use the ExtraSections feature,
  you must check that the parameter(s) ExtraSectionConditionX use a full
  REGEX syntax (with 5.x series, this parameter could contain simple string
  values). If not, feature will be broken.

Note 2: When migrating to 6.x series, if you use the Misc feature, you must
  check that your ShowMiscStats parameter is set to "ajdfrqwp", if you want
  to have all miscellanous info reported (you must also have added the
  awstats_misc_tracker.js script in your home page as described in
  MiscTrackerUrl parameter description). Otherwise the new default value "a"
  will be used (only the "Add to favourites" will be reported).

Note 3: In 6.x series, MaxLengthOfURL parameter has been renamed into
  MaxLengthOfShownURL.

Note 4: When migrating to 6.x series, to enable the new worm detection, you
  must add parameter LevelForWormsDetection=2 in your config file.

Note 5: When migrating to 6.x series, if you used the urlalias or userinfo
  plugin, you must move the urlalias.*.txt or userinfo.*.txt file from Plugins
  directory to DirData directory.

  config file to have this feature working.
- Update process now try a direct access at last updated record when a new
  update is ran. If it fails (file changed or wrong checksum of record), then
  it does a scan from the beginning of file until a new date has been
  reached (This was the only way of working on older version). So now update
  process is very much faster for those who don't purge/rotate their log
  file between two update process (direct access is faster than full scan).
- Better look for report pages on Netscape/Mozilla browsers.

  not found' URLs are kept with parameters only if URLReferrerWithQuery is set
  to 1. This make this report more useful.

  tool to convert into a W3C log file.
