Note 1:
  AWStats 5.x are compatible with previous versions (3.x or 4.x).
  However if you use awstats 5.x runtime to read statistics for old month
  build with 3.x or 4.x, speed will be a little bit reduce but data will be
  reported correctly.

  To benefit the speed/memory improvement of 5.x (2 to 8 times faster when
  reading stats, less memory use) you can migrate (after backup) your history
  files with the command :
    awstats.pl -migrate="/fullpath/awstatsMMYYYY.configval.txt"

Note 2:
  Old deprecated command line parameter site= has been removed.
  Use config= instead (replace site= since 3.0).
