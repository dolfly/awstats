# Web server logfile to analyze, with full path or relative path from
# awstats.pl directory.
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
# Example: "/var/logs/httpd/myserver_access.log"
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/exyymm.log"
# With IIS, AWStats can automatically concat YYMM.log or YYMMDD.log at end,
# so the following example is also good with IIS.
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/ex"

# Put here your log format (Must match your web server config. See setup
# instructions in documentation know how to configure your web server to have
# the required log format).
# Possible values: 1,2,3,4,5 or "your_own_personalized_log_format"
# 1 - Apache native combined log format (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format)
# 2 - IIS log format (W3C log format)
# 3 - Webstar native log format
# 4 - Apache or Squid native common log format (NCSA common log format)
#     With LogFormat=4, some features (browsers, os, keywords...) can't work.
# 5 - ISA server native standard log format
# "your_own_personalized_log_format" = If your log is a personalized format,
#   you must use the following syntax keys to define the log format string:
#   %host             Host client name or IP address
#   %logname          Authenticated login/user used on protected pages
#   %time1            Date and time with format: [dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss +0000]

#   %methodurlnoprot  Method and URL with format: "GET /index.html"
#   %method           Method with format: GET
#   %url              URL only with format: /index.html
#   %query            Query string (used by URLWithQuery option)
#   %code             Return code status (with format for web log: 999)
#   %bytesd           Size of document in bytes
#   %refererquot      Referer page with format: "http://from.com/from.htm"
#   %referer          Referer page with format: http://from.com/from.htm
#   %uaquot           User agent with format: "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible, ...)"
#   %ua               User agent with format: Mozilla/4.0_(compatible...)
#   %gzipin           Mod_gzip compression input bytes: In:XXX
#   %gzipout          Mod_gzip compression output bytes & ratio: Out:YYY:ZZZpct.
#   %gzipratio        Mod_gzip compression ratio: ZZZpct.
#   %email            EMail sender (for mail log)
#   %email_r          EMail receiver (for mail log)
#   %syslog           Syslog-specific time and host stamp with format: Mon dd hh:mm:ss hostname
#   %virtualname      Web sever virtual hostname. Use this tag when same log
#                     file contains data of several virtual web servers. The
#                     SiteDomain will be used to filter the one you want.
#   If your log format has some fields not included in this list, use
#   %other            Means another field
#
# Examples for Apache combined logs (this two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 1
# LogFormat = "%host %other %logname %time1 %methodurl %code %bytesd %refererquot %uaquot"
#
# Examples for IIS (this two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 2
# LogFormat = "%time2 %host %logname %method %url %code %bytesd %other %ua %referer"
#
LogFormat="%time2 %email %email_r %host %host_r %method %url %code %bytesd"

# Set this to a directory where you want AWStats to save its working files.
# Need write permissions by web server user (user "nobody" with Unix OS).
# Example: "/tmp"
# Example: "../data"
# Example: "C:/awstats_working_dir"
# Default: "."          (means same directory as awstats.pl)
#
DirData="c:/Mes Developpements/awstats/test/awstats/result" 	

# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats.pl directory.
# Usefull only when AWStats is used from command line.
# Default: "/cgi-bin"   (means awstats.pl is in "/wwwroot/cgi-bin")
#
DirCgi="/cgi-bin"

# Relative or absolute web URL of all icons subdirectories.
# Default: "/icon" (means you must copy icons directories in "/wwwroot/icon")
#
DirIcons="c:/Mes Developpements/awstats/wwwroot/icon"

# If host names are already resolved in your logfile, set this to 0 will
# increase performances.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
# 
DNSLookup=0

# If AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to find new lines in your log file to process only new ones,
# so you can launch it as soon as you want, even with this parameter set to 0
# but if you work with this value, you MUST have something to clean sometimes
# your logfile if your web server don't do it.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0 	(but if you can, set this to 1 to increase speed)
#
#
PurgeLogFile=0

# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0

# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a this referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL
# of another site.
# Example: "www\.myserver\.com x\.y\.z\.w localhost 127\.0\.0\.1"

# menus, etc...) to exclude them from statistics.
# Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# Do not remove default values. 
# Example: "\.css \.js \.class robots\.txt badpage\.html /~"
# Default: "\.css \.js \.class robots\.txt"
#
SkipFiles="\.css \.js \.class robots\.txt"

# Do not include access from clients that match following IP address
# You can also put partial host names but this requires that reverse
# DNS lookup is already done in your server log file.
