# AWSTATS CONFIGURE FILE 5.0
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file into awstats.www.myserver.mydomain.conf or awstats.conf
# and edit this new file to setup AWStats (This config file must be in
# same directory than awstats.pl).
# If you don't understand what is a parameter, keep default value.

# Main setup section (Required to make AWStats working)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "LogFile" contains the web server logfile to analyze.
# Possible values: A full path, or a relative path from awstats.pl directory.
# Example: "/var/log/apache/access.log"
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
# You can also use tags in this filename if you need a dynamic file name
# depending on date or time (Replacement is made by AWStats at the beginning
# of its execution). This is available tags :
#   %YYYY-n  is replaced with 4 digits year we were n hours ago
#   %YY-n    is replaced with 2 digits year we were n hours ago
#   %MM-n    is replaced with month we were n hours ago
#   %DD-n    is replaced with day we were n hours ago
#   %HH-n    is replaced with hour we were n hours ago
#   %NS-n    is replaced with number of seconds at 00:00 since 1970
#   %WM-n    is replaced with the week number in month (1-5)
#   %WY-n    is replaced with the week number in year (1-52)
#   %DW-n    is replaced with the day number in week (1-7, 1=sunday)
#                              use n=24 if you need (1-7, 1=monday)
#   Use 0 for n if you need current year, month, day, hour...

# Put here your log format (Must agree with your web server. See setup
# instructions in README.txt to know how to configure your web server to have
# the required log format).
# Possible values: 1,2,3,4,5 or "your_own_personalised_log_format"
# 1 = Apache native combined log format (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format)
# 2 = IIS log format (W3C log format)
# 3 = Webstar native log format
# 4 = Apache or Squid native common log format (NCSA common log format)
#     With LogFormat=4, some features (browsers, os, keywords...) can't work.
# 5 = ISA server standard log format
# "your_own_personalised_log_format" = If your log is a personalised format,
#     you must use the following syntax keys to define the log format string:

#     %virtualname      Web sever virtual hostname. Use this tag when same log
#                       file contains data of several virtual web servers. The
#                       SiteDomain will be used to filter the one you want.
#     If your log format has some fields not included in this list, use
#     %other            Means another field
#
# Examples for Apache combined logs (this two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 1
# LogFormat = "%host %other %logname %time1 %methodurl %code %bytesd %refererquot %uaquot"
# Examples for IIS (this two examples are equivalent):

# If your log field's separator is not a space, you can change this parameter.
# Example: " "
# Example: "\t"
# Example: "|"
# Default: " "
#
#LogSeparator="\s"


# If you want to have information on domains/countries visitors, you must ask
# AWStats to make reverse DNS lookup (if not already done in your log file).
# With DNSLookup to 0, all hosts will be reported by their IP addresses and
# not by the full hostname of visitors. Domain/Country chart will also report
# all visitors from a domain/country "Unknown".
# If you need to set DNSLookup to 1, don't forget that reverse DNS lookup
# increase dramatically AWStats update process. Do not use on large web sites.
# Possible values:
#  0 No DNS Lookup
#  1 DNS Lookup is fully enabled
#  2 DNS Lookup is made only from DNS cache files
# Default: 2
# 
DNSLookup=1


# Set this to a directory where you want AWStats to save its working files.
# Need write permissions by web server user (user "nobody" with Unix OS).
# Example: "/tmp"
# Example: "../data"
# Example: "C:/awstats_working_dir"
# Default: "."          (means same directory as awstats.pl)
#
DirData="c:/Mes Developpements/awstats/test/awstats/result" 	


# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats.pl directory.
# Used only when AWStats is used from command line.
# Default: "/cgi-bin"   (means awstats.pl is in "/mywwwroot/cgi-bin")
#
DirCgi="/cgi-bin"


# Relative or absolute web URL of all icons subdirectories.
# Default: "/icon" (means you must copy icon directories in "/mywwwroot/icon")
#
DirIcons="/icon"


# "SiteDomain" must contain the main domain name or the main intranet web
# server name used to reach the web site.
# If you share the same log file for several virtual web servers, this
# parameter is used to tell AWStats to filter record that contains records for
# this virtual host name only (So check that this virtual hostname can be
# found in your log file and use a personalized log format that include the
# %virtualname tag).
# But for multi hosting a better solution is to have one log file for each
# virtual web server. In this case, this parameter is only used to generate
# full URL's links when ShowLinksOnUrl option is set to 1.
# Example: "www.mydomain.com"
# Example: "user.mydomain.com"
# Example: "myintranetserver"
#
SiteDomain="__AWSTATS_CURRENT_CONFIG__"


# Put here all other possible domain names, addresses or virtual host aliases
# someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum number of
# possible names/addresses to have the best performances.
# You can repeat the "SiteDomain" value in this list.
# Use space between each value.
# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL of
# another site.
# Example: "www.myserver.com x.y.z.w localhost 127.0.0.1"
#
HostAliases="www.partenor.com www.cybericard.tv www.myserver.com athenaawstats x.y.z.w localhost 127.0.0.1"


# When this parameter is set to 1, AWStats add a button on report page to
# allow to "update" statistics from a web browser. Warning, when "update" is
# made from a browser, AWStats is runned as a CGI by the web server user
# defined in your web server (user "nobody" by default with Apache, "IUSR_XXX"
# with IIS), so the "DirData" directory and all already existing history files
# (awstatsMMYYYY[.xxx].txt) must be writable by this user. Change permissions
# if required.
# Warning: Update process can be long so you might experience "time out"
# browser errors if you don't launch AWStats enough frequently.
# When set to 0, update is only made when AWStats is runned from the command
# line interface (or a task scheduler).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser=1



#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a static DNS cache file that was
# previously created manually. If no path is gave in static DNS cache file
# name, AWStats will search DirData directory. This file is never changed.
# This option is not used if DNSLookup=0.
# Note: DNS cache file must have format:  ipaddress  resolved_hostname
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscache"
# Default: "dnscache.txt"
#
DNSStaticCacheFile="dnscache.txt"


# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a DNS cache file that was created
# by a previous run of AWStats. This file is erased and recreated after each
# statistics update process. You don't need to create and/or edit it.
# AWStats will read and save this file in DirData directory.
# This option is not used if DNSLookup=0.
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscachelastupdate"
# Default: "dnscachelastupdate.txt"
#
DNSLastUpdateCacheFile="dnscachelastupdate.txt"


# You can specify specific IP addresses that should NOT be looked up in
#  the DNS. You may specify partial addresses (ie 163.85. for everything
#  behind the usual firewall setup, etc)...
# This option is used only if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Example: "163.85. 201.101.51.2"
# Default: ""
#
SkipDNSLookupFor=""


# The following two parameters allow you to protect a config file to be used
# by your AWStats program called from a browser only if web user has been
# authenticated. Your AWStats program must be in a web protected "realm" (With
# Apache, you can use .htaccess files to do so. With other web servers, see
# your server setup manual).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=1


# This parameter give the list of all authorized authenticated users to view
# statistics for this domain/config file. This parameter is used only if
# AllowAccessToAuthenticatedUsersOnly is set to 1.
# Example: "user1 user2"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers="rangercamping nima gavin"


# When this parameter is define to something, the IP address of the user that
# read its statistics from a browser (when AWStats is used as a CGI) is
# checked and must match the IP address range defined by this parameter.
# Example: "123.123.123.10-123.123.123.255"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingIPAddresses=""


# If the "DirData" directory (see above) does not exists, AWStats return an
# error. However, you can ask AWStats to create it. This option can be used by
# some Web Hosting Providers that has defined a dynamic value for DirData (for
# example DirData="/home/__REMOTE_USER__").
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
CreateDirDataIfNotExists=0


# AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to detect new lines in log file, to process only them, so
# you can launch AWStats as soon as you want, even with this parameter to 0.
# With 0, no purge is made, so you must use a scheduled task or a web server
# that make this purge frequently.
# With 1, the purge of the log file is made each time AWStats is runned.
# This parameter doesn't work with IIS (This web server doesn't let its log
# file to be purged).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
PurgeLogFile=0


# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0


# Each time you run the update process, AWStats overwrite the 'historic file'
# for the month (awstatsMMYYYY[.*].txt) with the updated one.
# When write errors occurs (IO, disk full,...), this historic file can be
# corrupted and must be deleted. Because this file contains information of all
# past processed log files, you will loose old stats if removed. So you can
# ask AWStats to save last non corrupted file in a .bak file. This file is
# stored in "DirData" directory with other 'historic files'.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
KeepBackupOfHistoricFiles=0


# Index page name for your web server.
# Example: "default.htm"
# Default: "index.html"
#
DefaultFile="index.php index.html"


# Do not include access from clients that match following criterias.
# If your log file contains IP adresses in host field, you must put here
# matching IP adresses criterias.
# If DNS lookup is already done in your log file, you must put here hostname
# criterias.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Example: "127.0.0.1 163.84. 201.101.51.1"
# Example: "localhost abcxyz"
# Default: ""
#
SkipHosts=""


# Do not include access from clients with a user agent that match following
# criteria. If you want to exclude a robot, you should update the robots.pm
# file instead of this parameter.
# Note: Use space between each value. This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Example: "konqueror"
# Default: ""
#
SkipUserAgents=""


# Use SkipFiles to ignore access to URLs that match one of following entries.
# You can, with this option, add a list of not important frame pages (like 
# menus, etc...) to exclude them from statistics.
# For example, to ignore a whole directory tree, just add "directorytoignore",
# to ignore "users" homepage in your stats, you can add "/~".
# The oposite parameter of "SkipFiles" is "OnlyFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values.
# Note: xxx$ means URL ending with xxx.
# Example: "robots.txt$ favicon.ico$ badpage.html /~"
# Default: "robots.txt$ favicon.ico$"
#
#SkipFiles="robots.txt$ favicon.ico$"
SkipFiles=""

# Include in stats, only accesses to URLs that match one of following entries.
# For example, if you want AWStats to filter access to keep only stats that
# match a particular string, like a particular directory, you can add this
# directory name in this parameter.
# The oposite parameter of "OnlyFiles" is "SkipFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values
# Note: xxx$ means URL ending by xxx.
# Example: "marketing_directory"
# Default: ""
#
OnlyFiles=""

# Add here a list of kind of url (file extension) that must be counted as
# "Hit only" and not as a "Hit" and "Page viewed". You can set here all images
# extensions as they are hit downloaded that must be counted but they are not
# viewed pages. URL with such extensions are not included in the TOP Pages/URL
# report.
# Note: If you want to exclude your own URLs from stats (No Pages and no Hits
# reported), you should use SkipFiles parameter instead.
# Example: ""
# Example: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp zip arj gz z wav mp3 wma mpg"
# Default: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp"
#
NotPageList="css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp"

# By default, AWStats considers that records found in log file are successfull
# hits if HTTP code returned by server is a valid HTTP code (200 and 302).
# Any other code are reported in HTTP error chart.
# However in some specific environnement, whith web server HTTP redirection,
# you can choose to also accept other codes (like 304).
# Example: "200 302 304"
# Default: "200 302"
#
ValidHTTPCodes="200 304"


# Some web servers on some Operating systems (IIS-Windows) considers that two
# URLs with same value but different case are the same URL. To tell AWStats to
# also considers them as one, set this parameter to 1.
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
# 
URLNotCaseSensitive=0


# In URL links, "?" char is used to add parameters list in URLs. Syntax is:
# /mypage.html?param1=value1&param2=value2
# However, some servers/sites have also others chars to isolate dynamic part of
# their URLs. You can complete this list with this parameter.
# Example: "?;"
# Default: "?"
#
URLQuerySeparators=" ?   ;&"


# Keep or attach the query string to the URL in the statistics for individual
# pages. This is primarily used to differentiate between the URLs of dynamic
# pages. If set to 1, mypage.html?id=x and mypage.html?id=y are counted as two
# different pages.
# Warning, when set to 1, memory required to run AWStats is dramatically
# increased if you have a lot of changing URLs (for example URLs with a random
# id inside). Such web sites should not set this option to 1 or use seriously
# the next parameter URLWithQueryWithoutFollowingParameters.
# Possible values:
# 0 - URLs are cleaned from the query string (ie: "/mypage.html")
# 1 - Full URL with query string is used     (ie: "/mypage.html?p=x&q=y")
# Default: 0
# 
URLWithQuery=1


# When URLWithQuery is on, you will get the full URL with all parameters in
# URL reports. But among thoose parameters, sometimes you don't need a
# particular parameter because it does not identify the page or because it's
# a random ID changing for each access even if URL points to same page. In
# such cases, it is higly recommanded to ask AWStats to keep only parameters
# you need (if you know them) before counting, manipulating and storing it.
# Enter here list of wanted parameters. For example, with "mode", one hit on
# /mypage.cgi?mode=abc&id=Yo4UomP9d and /mypage.cgi?mode=abc&id=Mu8fdxl3r
# will be reported as 2 hits on /mypage.cgi?mode=abc
# This parameter is not used when URLWithQuery is 0 and can't be used with
# URLWithQueryWithoutFollowingParameters.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "mode action"
# Default: ""
# 
URLWithQueryWithOnlyFollowingParameters=""


# When URLWithQuery is on, you will get the full URL with all parameters in
# URL reports. But among thoose parameters, sometimes you don't need a
# particular parameter because it does not identify the page or because it's
# a random ID changing for each access even if URL points to same page. In
# such cases, it is higly recommanded to ask AWStats to remove such parameters
# from the URL before counting, manipulating and storing it. Enter here list
# of all non wanted parameters. For example if you enter "id", one hit on
# /mypage.cgi?p=abc&id=Yo4UomP9d and /mypage.cgi?p=abc&id=Mu8fdxl3r
# will be reported as 2 hits on /mypage.cgi?p=abc
# This parameter is not used when URLWithQuery is 0 and can't be used with

# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "PHPSESSID jsessionid"
# Default: ""
# 
URLWithQueryWithoutFollowingParameters="x y"

#
WarningMessages=1


# To help you to detect if your log format is good, AWStats report an error
# if the first NbOfLinesForCorruptedLog lines have all a format that does not
# match the LogFormat parameter.
# However, some worm virus attack on your web server can result in a very high
# number of corrupted lines in your log. So if you experience awstats stop
# because of bad virus records, you can increase this parameter (very rare).
# Default: 50
#
NbOfLinesForCorruptedLog=50


# Search engines keywords reported are full search string or separate keywords
# Possible values:
# 0 - Search keywords reported are full search string (ie: "town maps")
