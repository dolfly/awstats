# AWStats configure file
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file into awstats.www.myserver.mydomain.conf or awstats.conf
# and edit this new file to setup AWStats.
# If you don't understand what is a parameter, keep default value.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Main setup section (Required to /test AWStats working)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Web server logfile to analyze, with full path or relative path from
# awstats.pl directory.
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
# Example: "/var/logs/httpd/myserver_access.log"
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/exyymm.log"
# With IIS, AWStats can automatically concat YYMM.log or YYMMDD.log at end,
# so the following example is also good with IIS.
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/ex"
#
LogFile="c:/Mes Developpements/awstats/test/log/__AWSTATS_CURRENT_CONFIG__.log"

# Put here your log format (it depends on your web server).
# Possible values:
# 1 - Apache combined log format
# 2 - IIS extended W3C log format
#
LogFormat=1

# Set this to a directory where you want AWStats to save its working files.
# Need write permissions by web server user (user "nobody" with Unix OS).
# Example: "/tmp"
# Example: "../data"
# Example: "C:/awstats_working_dir"
# Default: "."          (means same directory as awstats.pl)
#
DirData="c:/Mes Developpements/awstats/test/awstats/result" 	

# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats.pl directory.
# Usefull only when AWStats is used from command line.
# Default: "/cgi-bin"   (means awstats.pl is in "/wwwroot/cgi-bin")
#
DirCgi="/cgi-bin"

# Relative or absolute web URL of all icons subdirectories.
# Default: "/icon" (means you must copy icons directories in "/wwwroot/icon")
#
DirIcons="c:/Mes Developpements/awstats/wwwroot/icon"

# If host names are already resolved in your logfile, set this to 0 will
# increase performances.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
# 
DNSLookup=0

# If AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to find new lines in your log file to process only new ones,
# so you can launch it as soon as you want, even with this parameter set to 0
# but if you work with this value, you MUST have something to clean sometimes
# your logfile if your web server don't do it.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0 	(but if you can, set this to 1 to increase speed)
#
#
PurgeLogFile=0

# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0

SiteDomain="__AWSTATS_CURRENT_CONFIG__"



# Optionnal setup section (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Set your primary language.
# Possible value:
# 0=English, 1=French, 2=Dutch, 3=Spanish, 4=Italian, 5=German
# 6=Polish, 7=Greek
# Default: 0
#
Lang=0


# Index page name for your web server.
# Example: "default.htm"
# Default: "index.html"
#
DefaultFile="index.html"


# Enter here all other possible domain names, addresses or virtual host
# aliases someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum
# number of possible names/addresses to have the best performances.
# You can repeat the "SiteDomain" value in this list.
# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL of
# another site.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Note: You can use regular expression values writing value with REGEX[value].
# Example: "www.myserver.com localhost 127.0.0.1 REGEX[\.mydomain\.(net|org)$]"
#
HostAliases="localhost 127.0.0.1 REGEX[^.*\.myserver\.com$]"


# Use SkipFiles to ignore access to URLs that match one of following entries.
# You can enter a list of not important URLs (like framed menus, hidden pages,
# etc...) to exclude them from statistics. You must enter here exact relative
# URL as found in log file, or a matching REGEX value.
# For example, to ignore /badpage.html, just add "/badpage.html". To ignore
# all pages in a particular directory, add "REGEX[^\/directorytoexclude]".
# The opposite parameter of "SkipFiles" is "OnlyFiles".
# Note: Use space between each value. This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: You can use regular expression values writing value with REGEX[value].
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/badpage.html REGEX[^\/excludedirectory]"
# Default: ""
#
SkipFiles="/dir2/file2 REGEX[^\/dir1]"


# Do not include access from clients that match following IP address
# You can also put partial host names but this requires that reverse
# DNS lookup is already done in your server log file.
# Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# Example: "55\.55\.55\.55 222\.222\.222\.222 abcxyz"
# Default: ""
#
SkipHosts=""


# Some web servers on some Operating systems (IIS-Windows) considers that a
# login with same value but different case are the same login. To tell AWStats
# to also considers them as one, set this parameter to 1.
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0

# Keep or remove the anchor string you can find in some URLs.
# Possible values: 0 or 1

# EXTRA SECTION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# WARNING: Extra sections are experimental feature not stable yet !!!

# You can define your own charts, you choose here what are rows and columns
# keys. This feature is particularly usefull for marketing purpose, tracking
# products orders for example.
# For this, edit all parameters of Extra section. Each set of parameter is a
# different chart. For several charts, duplicate section changing the number.
# Note that each Extra section reduces AWStats speed by 10%.
#
# WARNING: A wrong setup of Extra section can result in a too large arrays
# that will consume all your memory, making AWStats unusable after several
# updates, so be sure to setup it correctly.
# In most cases, you don't need this feature.
#
# ExtraSectionNameX is title of your personalized chart.
# ExtraSectionConditionalX are conditions on URL and/or QUERY_STRING and/or
#   REFERER you can use to count or not the hit. Use "|" for "OR".
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitleX is the first column title of the chart.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnValuesX is a Regex string to tell AWStats how to 
#   extract the value used for first column. Each different value found will
#   be a different row. Be sure that list of different values is "limited" to
#   avoid "not enough memory" problems !
# ExtraSectionStatTypesX are things you want to count. You can use standard
#   code letters (P for pages,H for hits,B for bandwidth,L for last access).
# MaxNbOfExtraX is maximum number of rows shown in chart.
# MinHitExtraX is minimum number of hits required to be shown in chart.
#

# Example to report the 20 products the most ordered by "order.cgi" script
ExtraSectionName1="Product orders"
ExtraSectionCondition1="URL,/cgi-bin/order.cgi | URL,/cgi-bin2/order.cgi"
