# AWStats configure file
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file into awstats.www.myserver.mydomain.conf or awstats.conf
# and edit this new file to setup AWStats.
# If you don't understand what is a parameter, keep default value.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Main setup section (Required to /test AWStats working)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Web server logfile to analyze, with full path or relative path from
# awstats.pl directory.
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
# Example: "/var/logs/httpd/myserver_access.log"
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/exyymm.log"
# With IIS, AWStats can automatically concat YYMM.log or YYMMDD.log at end,
# so the following example is also good with IIS.
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/ex"
#
LogFile="c:/Mes Developpements/awstats/test/log/__AWSTATS_CURRENT_CONFIG__.log"

# Put here your log format (it depends on your web server).
# Possible values:
# 1 - Apache combined log format
# 2 - IIS extended W3C log format
#
LogFormat=1

# Set this to a directory where you want AWStats to save its working files.
# Need write permissions by web server user (user "nobody" with Unix OS).
# Example: "/tmp"
# Example: "../data"
# Example: "C:/awstats_working_dir"
# Default: "."          (means same directory as awstats.pl)
#
DirData="c:/Mes Developpements/awstats/test/awstats/result" 	

# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats.pl directory.
# Usefull only when AWStats is used from command line.
# Default: "/cgi-bin"   (means awstats.pl is in "/wwwroot/cgi-bin")
#
DirCgi="/cgi-bin"

# Relative or absolute web URL of all icons subdirectories.
# Default: "/icon" (means you must copy icons directories in "/wwwroot/icon")
#
DirIcons="c:/Mes Developpements/awstats/wwwroot/icon"


# If you want to have hosts reported by name instead of ip address, AWStats
# need to make reverse DNS lookups (if not already done in your log file).
# With DNSLookup to 0, all hosts will be reported by their IP addresses and
# not by the full hostname of visitors (except if names are already available
# in log file).
# If you want/need to set DNSLookup to 1, don't forget that this will reduce
# dramatically AWStats update process speed. Do not use on large web sites.
# Note: Reverse DNS lookup is done on IPv4 only (Enable ipv6 plugin for IPv6).
# Note: Result of DNS Lookup can be used to build the Country report. However
# it is highly recommanded to enable the plugin 'geoipfree' or 'geoip' to
# have an accurate Country report with no need of DNS Lookup.
# Possible values:
# 0 - No DNS Lookup
# 1 - DNS Lookup is fully enabled
# 2 - DNS Lookup is made only from static DNS cache file (if it exists)
# Default: 2
# 
DNSLookup=2


# If AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to find new lines in your log file to process only new ones,
# so you can launch it as soon as you want, even with this parameter set to 0
# but if you work with this value, you MUST have something to clean sometimes
# your logfile if your web server don't do it.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0 	(but if you can, set this to 1 to increase speed)
#
#
PurgeLogFile=0

# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When the update process run, AWStats can set a lock file in TEMP or TMP
# directory. This lock is to avoid to have 2 update processes running at the
# same time to prevent unknown conflicts problems and avoid DoS attacks when
# AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser is set to 1.
# Because, when you use lock file, you can experience sometimes problems in
# lock file not correctly removed (killed process for example requires that
# you remove the file manualy), this option is not enabled by default (Do
# not enable this option with no console server access).
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
EnableLockForUpdate=0


# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a static DNS cache file that was
# previously created manually. If no path is given in static DNS cache file
# name, AWStats will search DirData directory. This file is never changed.
# This option is not used if DNSLookup=0.
# Note: DNS cache file format is 'minsince1970 ipaddress resolved_hostname'
# or just 'ipaddress resolved_hostname'
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscache"
# Default: "dnscache.txt"
#
DNSStaticCacheFile="dnscache.txt"


# Set your primary language.
# Possible value:
# 0=English, 1=French, 2=Dutch, 3=Spanish, 4=Italian, 5=German
# 6=Polish, 7=Greek
# Default: 0
#
Lang=0

# Index page name for your web server.
# Example: "default.htm"
# Default: "index.html"
#
DefaultFile="index.html"

# Put here all possible domain names, addresses or virtual host aliases
# someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum number of
# possible names/adresses to have the best performances.
# Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a this referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL
# of another site.
# Example: "www\.myserver\.com x\.y\.z\.w localhost 127\.0\.0\.1"
#
HostAliases="www\.myserver\.com x\.y\.z\.w localhost 127\.0\.0\.1"

# Do not include access to URLs that match following entries.
# If you don't want to include users homepage in your stats, add "/~".
# You can also, if you want, add list of not important frame pages (like 
# menus, etc...) to exclude them from statistics.
# Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# Do not remove default values. 
# Example: "\.css \.js \.class robots\.txt badpage\.html /~"
# Default: "\.css \.js \.class robots\.txt"
#
SkipFiles="\.css \.js \.class robots\.txt"

# Do not include access from clients that match following IP address
# You can also put partial host names but this requires that reverse
# DNS lookup is already done in your server log file.
# Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# Example: "55\.55\.55\.55 222\.222\.222\.222 abcxyz"
# Default: ""
#
SkipHosts=""

# AWStats can detect setup problems or show you important informations to have
# a better use. Keep this to 1, except if AWStats says you can change it.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
