# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to find new lines in your log file to process only new ones,
# so you can launch it as soon as you want, even with this parameter set to 0
# but if you work with this value, you MUST have something to clean sometimes

# Default: 0 	(but if you can, set this to 1 to increase speed)
#
#
PurgeLogFile=0


# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after

# If you change this parameter, you must also change the
# awstatsmisctrackerurl variable into the awstats_misc_tracker.js file.

# Possible value: Name of javascript tracker file added in HTML code
# Default: "/js/awstats_misc_tracker.js"

# Add here a list of kind of url (file extension) that must be counted as

# WARNING: Extra sections are experimental feature not stable yet !!!

# You can define your own charts, you choose here what are rows and columns

# products orders for example.
# For this, edit all parameters of Extra section. Each set of parameter is a
# different chart. For several charts, duplicate section changing the number.
# Note that each Extra section reduces AWStats speed by 10%.
#
# WARNING: A wrong setup of Extra section can result in a too large arrays
# that will consume all your memory, making AWStats unusable after several
# updates, so be sure to setup it correctly.
# In most cases, you don't need this feature.
#
# ExtraSectionNameX is title of your personalized chart.
# ExtraSectionConditionalX are conditions on URL and/or QUERY_STRING and/or
#   REFERER you can use to count or not the hit. Use "|" for "OR".
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitleX is the first column title of the chart.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnValuesX is a Regex string to tell AWStats how to 
#   extract the value used for first column. Each different value found will
#   be a different row. Be sure that list of different values is "limited" to
#   avoid "not enough memory" problems !
# ExtraSectionStatTypesX are things you want to count. You can use standard
