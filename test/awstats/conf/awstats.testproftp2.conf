# Main setup section (Required to make AWStats working)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

LogType="F"


# Web server logfile to analyze, with full path or relative path from
# awstats.pl directory.
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/exyymm.log"
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/ex"
#
LogFile="C:/Mes Developpements/awstats/test/log/testproftpd2.log"


# Put here your log format (it depends on your web server).
# Possible values:
# 1 = Apache combined log format
# 2 = IIS extended W3C log format
#
LogFormat="%time1 %host %logname %method %url %code %bytesd" 


# Set this to a directory where you want AWStats to save its working files.
# Need write permissions by web server.
# Example: "../data", "C:/HISTORYDIR", ...
# Default: "." means same directory as awstats.pl
#
DirData="c:/temp"


# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats.pl directory.
# Usefull only when AWStats is used from command line.
# Default: "/cgi-bin" means awstats.pl is in "yourwwwroot/cgi-bin"
#
DirCgi="/cgi-bin/awstats"


# Relative or absolute web URL of all icons subdirectories.
# Default: "/icon" means you must copy icons directories in "yourwwwroot/icon"
#
DirIcons="/icon"


# When this parameter is set to 1, AWStats add a button on report page to
# allow to "update" statistics from a web browser. Warning, when "update" is
# made from a browser, AWStats is ran as a CGI by the web server user defined
# in your web server (user "nobody" by default with Apache, "IUSR_XXX" with
# IIS), so the "DirData" directory and all already existing history files
# awstatsMMYYYY[.xxx].txt must be writable by this user. Change permissions if
# necessary to "Read/Write" (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Warning: Update process can be long so you might experience "time out"
# browser errors if you don't launch AWStats enough frequently.
# When set to 0, update is only made when AWStats is ran from the command
# line interface (or a task scheduler).
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser=0


# If host names are already resolved in your logfile, set this to 0 will
# increase performances.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
# 
DNSLookup=0


# "SiteDomain" must contain the main domain name or the main intranet web
# server name used to reach the web site.
# This parameter is only used to generate full URLs links when ShowLinksOnUrl
# option is set to 1.
# Example: "www.mydomain.com"
# Example: "user.mydomain.com"
# Example: "myintranetserver"
# Default: ""
#
SiteDomain="myftpserver.com"


# Put here all other possible domain names, addresses or virtual host aliases
# someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum number of
# possible names/addresses to have the best performances.
# You can repeat the "SiteDomain" value in this list.
# Use space between each value.
# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL of
# another site.
# Example: "www.myserver.com x.y.z.w localhost 127.0.0.1"

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The following two parameters allow you to protect a config file to be used
# by your AWStats program called from a browser only if web user has been
# authenticated. Your AWStats program must be in a web protected "realm" (With
# Apache, you can use .htaccess files to do so. With other web servers, see
# your server setup manual).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=0

# This parameter give the list of all authorized authenticated users to view
# statistics for this domain/config file. This parameter is used only if
# AllowAccessToAuthenticatedUsersOnly is set to 1.
# Example: "user1 user2"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers=""

# If the "DirData" directory (see above) does not exists, AWStats return an
# error. However, you can ask AWStats to create it. This option can be used by
# some Web Hosting Providers that has defined a dynamic value for DirData (for
# example DirData="/home/__REMOTE_USER__").
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
CreateDirDataIfNotExists=0

# AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to detect new lines in log file, to process only them, so
# you can launch AWStats as soon as you want, even with this parameter to 0.
# With 0, no purge is made, so you must use a scheduled task or a web server
# that make this purge frequently.
# With 1, the purge of the log file is made each time AWStats is runned.
# This parameter doesn't work with IIS (This web server doesn't let its log
# file to be purged).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
PurgeLogFile=0


# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0


# Set your primary language.
# Possible value: 0 = English, 1 = French, 2 = Dutch, 3 = Spanish

# Index page name for your web server.
# Default: "index.html"
#
DefaultFile=""


# Use SkipFiles to ignore access to URLs that match one of following entries.
# You can, with this option, add a list of not important frame pages (like 
# menus, etc...) to exclude them from statistics.
# For example, to ignore a whole directory tree, just add "directorytoignore",
# to ignore "users" web site pages in your stats, you can add "REGEX[^/~]".
# The opposite parameter of "SkipFiles" is "OnlyFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values.
# Note: You can use regular expression values writing value with REGEX[value].
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/badpage.html REGEX[^/~]"
# Default: ""
#
SkipFiles=""


# Include in stats, only accesses to URLs that match one of following entries.
# For example, if you want AWStats to filter access to keep only stats that
# match a particular string, like a particular directory, you can add this
# directory name in this parameter.
# The oposite parameter of "OnlyFiles" is "SkipFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values
# Note: \. means . and xxx$ means URL ending by xxx.
# Example: "marketing_directory"
# Default: ""
#
OnlyFiles=""


# Add here a list of kind of url (file extension) that must be counted as
# "Hit only" and not as a "Hit" and "Page/Download". You can set here all
# images extensions as they are hit downloaded that must be counted but they
# are not viewed pages. URLs with such extensions are not included in the TOP
# Pages/URL report.
# Note: If you want to exclude your own URLs from stats (No Pages and no Hits
# reported), you should use SkipFiles parameter instead.
# Example: ""
# Example: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp zip arj gz z wav mp3 wma mpg"
# Default: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp"
#
NotPageList=""


# Keep or attach the query string to the URL in the statistics for individual
# pages. This is primarily used to differentiate between the URLs of dynamic
# pages. If set to 1, mypage.html?id=x and mypage.html?id=y are counted as
# two different pages.
# Possible values:
# 0 - URLs are cleaned from the query string (ie: "/mypage.html")
# 1 - Full URL with query string is used     (ie: "/mypage.html?x=y")
# Default: 0
# 
URLWithQuery=0

# Do not include access from clients that match following IP address
# You can also put partial host names but this requires that reverse
# DNS lookup is already done in your server log file.
# Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# Example: "55\.55\.55\.55 222\.222\.222\.222 abcxyz"
# Default: ""
#
SkipHosts=""

# EXTRA SECTION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can define your own charts, you choose here what are rows and columns
# keys. This feature is particularly usefull for marketing purpose, tracking
# products orders for example.
# For this, edit all parameters of Extra section. Each set of parameter is a
# different chart. For several charts, duplicate section changing the number.
# Note that each Extra section reduces AWStats speed by 8%.
#
# WARNING: A wrong setup of Extra section can result in a too large arrays
# that will consume all your memory, making AWStats unusable after several
# updates, so be sure to setup it correctly.
# In most cases, you don't need this feature.
#
# ExtraSectionNameX is title of your personalized chart.
# ExtraSectionConditionalX are conditions on URL and/or QUERY_STRING and/or
#   REFERER you can use to count or not the hit. Use "|" for "OR".
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitleX is the first column title of the chart.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnValuesX is a Regex string to tell AWStats how to 
#   extract the value used for first column. Each different value found will
#   be a different row. Be sure that list of different values is "limited" to
#   avoid "not enough memory" problems !
# ExtraSectionStatTypesX are things you want to count. You can use standard
#   code letters (P for pages,H for hits,B for bandwidth,L for last access).
# MaxNbOfExtraX is maximum number of rows shown in chart.
# MinHitExtraX is minimum number of hits required to be shown in chart.
#

# Example to report the 20 products the most ordered by "order.cgi" script
